Problem: Determine the amount of customer delay when there are n check-out lines.Requirements: You must submit the following Java classes to Canvas as specified inthis document.public class Person{//corresponds to a customerint arrivalTime;int departureTime;int processing Time;}public class Event{//corresponds to either an arrival or departureString type; //can be “arrival” or “departure”int time;//if “arrival”, this will be the arrival time of a job; if “departure”,//this will be the departure time of a jobint param; if “arrival”, this will be the processing time of a job; if//“departure”, this will be the checkout line that had a departure event}public class PersonQueue{int totalTime; //the sum of all processing times in this queue//can use any structure//because this is a queue, you will need enqueue(), dequeue(), isEmpty()}public class EventPQueue{//because this is a priority queue, you will need enqueue(), dequeue(), isEmpty()}public class Store{PersonQueue[] mypq;EventPQueue myeq;int numberOfQueues;//optionalint totalDelay;//optional// will probably need an add method that adds a Person to the PersonQueue with the//least number of people//will probably need a remove method that removes a person from a PersonQueue who//has finished the checkout process}public class Driver{//contains the main method//allows the user to provide the following parameters (a)number of check out//lines, (b) number of persons/customers, (c) min and max time between person//arrivals, (d) min and //max processing time for a person//during run time, the time between arrivals and processing times will be randomly//selected within the user defined ranges}You may add methods and additional fields as you see fit.Sample Output:Welcome to Job SimulatorHow many queues do you want to simulate?&gt; 2How many customers do you want to simulate?&gt; 5What is the minimum time between job arrivals?&gt; 2What is the maximum time between job arrivals?&gt; 5What is the minimum processing time for a job?&gt; 6What is the maximum processing time for a job?&gt; 8Time Activity0 Customer Arrives (processing time 7) – Customer Joins Queue 12 Customer Arrives (processing time 8) – Customer Joins Queue 25 Customer Arrives (processing time 8) – Customer Joins Queue 17 Customer Departs Queue 19 Customer Arrives (processing time 8) – Customer Joins Queue 110 Customer Departs Queue 212 Customer Arrives (processing time 6) – Customer Joins Queue 215 Customer Departs Queue 118 Customer Departs Queue 223 Customer Departs Queue 1Total Delay: 8
